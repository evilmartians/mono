- [New look of section signs](https://twitter.com/romanshamin_en/status/1479523955081945089).
- [New look of copyright signs](https://twitter.com/romanshamin_en/status/1479884106410479623): more balanced.
- [New look of pound sterling](https://twitter.com/romanshamin_en/status/1480600396330643456).
